"""
- Why are we learning number and math ?
- The first most foundational thing that we learn about any language is
- that, how that language handles data, what all sorts of data can we
- manage using that particular language. sales data, user data etc
- some of those data will be numeric, number of shoes sold, price of shoes etc

- OBJECTIVES
- Understand difference between ints and floats
- Work with simple mathematical operators
- Weirder mathematical operators
- Add comments to your code (Completely unrelated by has to go somewhere)
