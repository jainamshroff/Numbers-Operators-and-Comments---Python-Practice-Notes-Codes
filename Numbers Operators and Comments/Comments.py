Comments in python

- comments are a way to write little notes inside our code
- single line comments can be written after # everything after # will be commented out
- Multiple lines comment are written inside three quotes on each side
- Comments are important in many scenarios, when you are working in team
- and you want to tell someone reading your code informing something from
- your code.

"""

print(1/3) # Division returns float even when dividing two ints

# this does not affect out code execution at all
# but if you write comment without pound sign it will cause errors
# print(1/3) this also won't be printed

# python interpreter just ignores everything inside comment
