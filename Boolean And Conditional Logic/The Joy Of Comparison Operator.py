Comparison operators

a = 1 and b = 1

== - Truthy if a is equal to b        -  a == b True
!= - Truthy if a is not equal to b        -  a != b False
> - Truthy if a is greater than b       -  a > b False
< - Truthy if b is greater than a       -  a < b False
>= - Truthy if a is greater equal to b       -  a >= b True
<= - Truthy if b is greater than equal to a       -  a <= b True


At the end of the day it either returns True or False
