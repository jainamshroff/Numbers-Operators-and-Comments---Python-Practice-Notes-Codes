 is vs ==

 in python

 a = 1
 a == 1 - True
 a is 1 -  True

 a = [1, 2, 3]
 b = [1, 2, 3]

 a == b - True
 a is b - False

 == - checks for the values
 is - checks if they are stored in the same place in the memory

 comparing the values we use ==
 to see if they are in the same place in the memory we use "is"

 c = b
 b is c - True as c is just the new pointer to the new memory
