"""

None - the N should be capital

it is a special case

its purpose of None the idea is to show nothingness
it is python's version of null

when to use it ?

app which takes user input
where you ask for age name and you have a field called child name
but not everyone has child
so we set child as None for the person having no child
so that when you try to access it later it wont throw any error

None is way of representing nothingness

it is clear indicator that there is nothing here but i want the variable
