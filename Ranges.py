# Ranges
# ranges are generally used with for loops
# for loops and ranges work with hand in hand

# range is simply a way to generate number within two limits
# imagine it as slice of a number line
# but more than that it has steps, which is how many gaps between two numbers
# positive step means count forward and negative step means count backwards
